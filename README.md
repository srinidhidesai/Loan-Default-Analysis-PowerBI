# Loan-Default-Analysis-PowerBI
Project Description

This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard using synthetic loan data to analyze loan distribution, borrower demographics, and default trends. DAX measures such as Year-over-Year (YoY) and Year-to-Date (YTD) are used to understand loan growth and financial risk patterns. This project was created for learning and portfolio purposes.

# Data Disclaimer

The dataset used in this project is synthetic (fake) data generated for practice and learning. It does not represent real customers, real loans, or any financial institution.

#Dataset Overview

The synthetic dataset includes the following fields:
Loan amount, loan purpose, and loan date
Applicant age  and marital status
Employment type
Education level
Credit score 
Loan default status

# Dashboard Structure
🔹 Page 1: Loan Default Overview

What was analyzed:

Loan amount distribution by loan purpose.
Average income by employment type.
Default rate by employment type.
Average loan amount by age group.
Year-wise default rate trends.

What I found:

Home and business loans have the highest loan amounts.
Higher default rates are seen among unemployed and part-time applicants.
Default rates are mostly stable across years.

🔹 Page 2: Applicant Demographics and Financial Profile

What was analyzed:

Median loan amount by credit score.
Loan distribution by age group and marital status.
Total loan amount by credit score category.
Loan count by education level.
Effect of dependents and mortgage status.

What I found:

Applicants with medium and high credit scores receive higher loan amounts.
Married applicants show slightly higher loan exposure.
Bachelor’s degree holders have the highest number of loans.

🔹 Page 3: Financial Risk Metrics

What was analyzed:

Year-over-Year (YoY) % change in loan amount.
Year-over-Year (YoY) % change in defaulted loan amount.
Year-to-Date (YTD) loan amount by credit score and marital status.
Loan distribution by income and employment type.

What I found:

Loan growth changes from year to year.
Default loan amounts increase in some years, indicating higher risk.
High-income, full-time employees contribute the most to total loan amount.



# Conclusion
In this project, I analyzed a synthetic loan dataset using Power BI to understand loan distribution, applicant characteristics, and default trends. By creating multiple visuals and DAX measures , I was able to identify how factors like employment type, income level, and credit score affect loan amounts and default behavior. This project helped me improve my understanding of financial data analysis, DAX calculations, and dashboard building in Power BI, and gave me hands-on experience in converting raw data into meaningful insights.
